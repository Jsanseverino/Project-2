1.  Graph Represents the Distribution of Exit Velocities Hit into Each Zone
Make the graph give the average exit velocity for a specific zone with new loop:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
for (i in 1:7) {
  
  
}
Zone<-factor(baseball_data$used_zone)
graph1<-ggplot(baseball_data, aes(x=Zone,y=exit_velocity, fill = Zone)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("purple","blue","light green","maroon", "orange","pink","yellow")) +
  xlab("Zone") + ylab("Exit Velocity") + ggtitle("Exit Velocity vs Zone Baseball Landed")
print(graph1) +
theme_linedraw()

#fill=c("purple","blue","light green","maroon", "orange","pink","yellow")
```
